Welcome to my PROJECTS repositoryâ€”a centralized hub for all my data-driven projects, analyses, and explorations. This repository serves as a structured collection of my work in data analysis, visualization, machine learning, and automation, showcasing my technical skills and problem-solving approach.

What Youâ€™ll Find Here
Each project is organized into its own dedicated folder, containing:

âœ… Jupyter Notebooks & Scripts â€“ Data preprocessing, analysis, and model development.

âœ… Visualizations & Dashboards â€“ Interactive charts, reports, and Google Looker Studio dashboards.

âœ… Datasets & Documentation â€“ Processed datasets and detailed project descriptions.

âœ… Key Findings & Insights â€“ Summaries of analytical outcomes and potential applications.

Objectives
Apply data science techniques to real-world problems.

Explore trends and patterns through visualization.
